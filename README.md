# HallPass

social media app for students in school to communicate/coordinate with their classmates, share notes/user-made quizzes and geotag study-rooms/tutors/meeting places, etc.

To set up:
make sure you have the usual stuff, ionic, cordova, bower(for dependency management). Optionally, if you wanna use an IDE, you can use visual studio but remember to download/update apache cordova and ionic tools though visual studio's interface
then:<br><br>
1.) clone to a directory <br>
2.) navigate into project folder and bower install angular-mocks --save (this step shouldn't be necessary, since dependency listed in bower.json, but mine needed it so, I guess if you wanna skip it and check first, that's fine)<br>
3.) build and edit.<br><br>

Optional: (if you wanna use Visual Studio for editing and testing and emulating)<br>
4.) Open Visual Studio.<br>
5.) Click new project from existing source.<br>
6.) Select apache cordova for project type in the window that opens, navigate to directory (make sure it's the one with www root folder), name the solution, then click finish. <br>
7.) Build and run. If you get a problem, try closing and opening visual studio.
